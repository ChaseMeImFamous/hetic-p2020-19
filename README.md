## Requirements
- Node 8.1.4
- Gulp 4.0
- Yarn 1.2.1

## Setup and installation
Before installing the project, make sure to match all the requirements listed above.
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kevinbrillion/hetic-p2020-19.git

# Go to project folder
cd hetic-p2020-19

# Install packages
yarn install
```

## Running
In order to work on our project, we use Yarn.
```sh
yarn run dev
```
That will launch browser sync and allow you to visit the website on ``` http://localhost:3000/``` (on development phase).

## Building the app
Use the build yarn task to

```sh
yarn run build
```

That will generate productions files in the ```/dist``` folder, which you can then serve for production.
